# Old-Multiplayer-Website-Explorer
old prototype for a game that lets you explore the internet in a maze like environment - with multiplayer

If you have node.js with npm installed, download and install the required packages with "npm install"
then run the web server with "node server.js", after that visit localhost:3000 to try the prototype

Honestly I'm surpised this still works, atleast in chrome it does.
